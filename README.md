# spEdit404
*This tool has gone from mostly working back to POC*


*Update: note, patterns and audio rendering of current pattern are up and running using track.py and wave.py. Next step is to test binary read / write, and create a better GIU/TUI*


spEdit is a tool for modifying and creating binary pattern files for the Roland SP-404SX. For more information check out my series of blog posts about the sp404SX pattern format and the spEdit tool : [spEdit blog posts!](http://byteflip.club/categories/sp-edit)
